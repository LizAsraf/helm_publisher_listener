ARGOCD Deployment with app of apps
This is "chart of applications". Deploying this chart will automatically deploy all charts found in the special charts/ directory.

Theis chart defines how all of your apps deployed, and you only need to make changes there.

In terms of differeniating the chart between each app, you may wish to, for example, keep everything the same except for a Docker image tied to that specific app.
